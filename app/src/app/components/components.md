The components in the `Base` directory are lifted from [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com). As the [introduction page](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs) says,

> This is NOT a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.
> 
> **What do you mean by not a component library?**
> 
> I mean you do not install it as a dependency. It is not available or distributed via npm.
> 
> Pick the components you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs. The code is yours.
